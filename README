ChatBot-Simple

ChatBot::Simple is a new and flexible chatbot engine in Perl.

Instead of specifying the chatbot knowledge base in xml, we are
going to use the powerfult text manipulation capabilities of Perl.

Simple example:

	pattern 'hello' => 'hi!';

Multiple (random) responses:

	pattern 'hello' => [ 'hi!', 'hello!', 'wazzzzup!' ];

Transforms:

	transform "what's" => "what is";
	pattern "what is your name" => "my name is ChatBot::Simple";

Named parameters:

	pattern "my name is :name" => "hello, :name!";

Code execution:

	my %mem;

	pattern "my name is :name" => sub {
		my ($str,$param);
		$mem{name} = $param->':name';
	} => "nice to meet you, :name!";

	pattern "what is my name?" => sub {
		return $mem{name} ? "Your name is $mem{name}"
		                  : "I don't know!";
	};

Multiple named parameters:

	my %var;

	pattern "define :variable as :value" => sub {
		my ($str,$param);

		my $variable = $param->{':variable'};
		my $value    = $param->{':value'};

		$var{$variable} = $value;

		return;
	} => 'ok';

Regular expressions:

	pattern qr{what is (\d+) ([+-/*]) (\d+)} => sub {
		my ($str,$param) = @_;
		my ($n1,$op,$n2) = ($param->{1}, $param->{2}, $param->{3});
		# ...
		return $result;
	};

(See more examples in the "t/" directory.)
