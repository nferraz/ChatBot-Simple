ChatBot-Simple

ChatBot::Simple is a new and flexible chatbot engine in Perl.

Instead of specifying the chatbot knowledge base in xml, we are
going to use the powerfult text manipulation capabilities of Perl.

Simple example:

	pattern 'hello' => 'hi!';

Multiple (successive) responses:

	pattern 'hello' => [ 'hi!', 'I already said hi!' ];

Transforms:

	transform "what's" => "what is";
	pattern "what is your name" => "my name is ChatBot::Simple";

There are some powerful features that I'm planning, that will make
ChatBot::Simple much more powerful than any engine I know of.

Named variables:

	pattern "my name is :name" => "hello, :name!";

Code execution:

	my %mem;

	pattern "my name is :name" => sub {
		# save name for later use
		$mem{name} = param('name');
	} => "nice to meet you, :name!";

	pattern "I am :age years old" => sub {
		# save name for later use
		$mem{age} = param('age');
	} => "cool!";
